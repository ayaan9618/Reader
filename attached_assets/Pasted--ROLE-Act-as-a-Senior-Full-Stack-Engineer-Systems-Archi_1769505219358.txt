🎯 ROLE

Act as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Systems Architect, and Product Designer.
Build a Matter-inspired content curation and reading web app — a lightweight MVP for saving articles, highlighting text, adding notes, and listening via Text-to-Speech.

This is NOT a full Matter clone.
Prioritize speed, usability, clean UI, real functionality, performance, and shipping fast.
